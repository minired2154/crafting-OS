# Introduction
This repository is integrated by referring other two educational RISC-V OS
- [mini-riscv-os](https://github.com/cccriscv/mini-riscv-os)
- [riscv-operating-system-mooc](https://gitee.com/unicornx/riscv-operating-system-mooc?_from=gitee_search)

This repository is used for enhancing the computer concept we learn from school. In this repository it cover the CPU scheduling, memory management, interrupt, etc.

The lecture name will follow [riscv-operating-system-mooc](https://gitee.com/unicornx/riscv-operating-system-mooc?_from=gitee_search) but the code will be slightly difference.

# Dependence
We need QEMU and GNU Toolchain as our virtual machine and cross compiler. Either can be found on the following link.
- [SiFive Software](https://www.sifive.com/software)

# Useage
Every folder under `lecture/` directory can simpily execute `make run` command to star runing the OS on qemu.
