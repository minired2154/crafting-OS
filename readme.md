# Introduction
This repository is integrated by refing other two educational RISC-V OS
- [mini-riscv-os](https://github.com/cccriscv/mini-riscv-os)
- [riscv-operating-system-mooc](https://gitee.com/unicornx/riscv-operating-system-mooc?_from=gitee_search)

# Dependence
we need QEMU as our virtual machine and GNU Toolchain to cross compile our C/assembly code. Either can be found on the following link.

# Useage
Every folder under `lecture/` directory can simpily execute `make run` command to star runing the OS on qemu.
